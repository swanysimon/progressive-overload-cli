{-
 - The Juggernaut Method states that you should adjust your estimated working max to never be
 - more than 95% of your calculated one rep max
 -
 - I ignore this when someone performs the expected numberby keeping the weight the same
 -
 - I also ignore this when the calculated 95% max is less than the previous weight when someone
 - performs more than the expected number of reps
